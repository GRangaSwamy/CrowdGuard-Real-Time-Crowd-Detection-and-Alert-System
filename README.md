# CrowdGuard-Real-Time-Crowd-Detection-and-Alert-System
Crowd Detection with Alert System This project uses OpenCV to detect crowds in real-time through a video feed. It identifies people using Haar cascades and calculates the distance between detected individuals. If the crowd density exceeds a specified threshold, an alert message is displayed on the screen to warn about overcrowding.
